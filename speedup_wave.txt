This code is used to change the playback speed of WAV audio files and save the result in a new directory. First, the path to the folder containing the WAV audio files is stored in the `folder_path` variable. Then, all files with the .wav extension in this folder are obtained using the `os.listdir()` function and stored in the `wav_files` list.

For each of the audio files, the file is opened using the `wave.open()` function to check its input format. Then, the WAV file is loaded using the `pydub` library. The audio speed is increased by a factor of 1.4 using the `pydub.AudioSegment.speedup()` function and the resulting file is saved in the new path `finaladd` in WAV format.

Finally, using the `pydub.AudioSegment.export()` function, the final file is returned to the original path with a lower speed and replaces the original file.
